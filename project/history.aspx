<h5 class="style2"><strong>History</strong></h5>
<p class="style1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient Syrian Christian family venkadathu originate from now known pilgrim centre thirupathi which was also known as “venkadam” and “thondanadu” hundreds of years ago. The major fraction of the people who lived there belong to the vellala clan who made their living mainly by agriculture.</p>
        <p class="style1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historian’s claim that by first century A.D. Saint Thomas who came to India preched about Jesus in and around “kaveripoopattanam” and “thondanadu” regions  and converted the vellala clan in those regions into Christians.In about third centuary A.D. due to the various atrocities in the place “venkadam” the “vellala” christians moved from there to “thiruvithamkodu” via the sea port called “poompuhar” as stated in various historical texts.They further travelled to the kollam district of Kerala. After reaching kollam they got engaged in tradeing of spices. There they were begun to be called as “vellala chettiyars” and the place they reside begun to be called as “mani gramam”(meaning mani village) and these group of people were called “manigramakkar” (meaning people hailing from the “mani village”).There is also a theory which states that they got trapped by a spiritual person called mani and his disciples and got the name “manigramakkar”.Among the people who got interested in mani and his disciples there were venkadathu family members this can proven by the very name the venkadathu family uses till today which is “venkadam”( venkadam means the people from the left).</p>
       <p class="style1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the advent of the eleventh centaury when Kollam and Kozhikode districts of Kerala was destroyed by the war between the chola and chora dynasty the venkadathu family moved to a place called palayur. The place called “thiruvenkidm” ,   a temple called “thiruvenkiteshvara temple” and a church called “thruvenkidam church” are the solid proof of this.By the 14th century A.D. due to the interest in agriculture and trade they further moved to a place called “udayamperoor” which was ruled by a Christian King belonging to Valyarvattom dynasty.</p>
       <p class="style1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the dawn of the 15th century when the valiyarvattom dynasty was destroyed they moved kottayam by the special interest of the thekkumkur king. The venkadathu family members who came to kottayam played a pivotal role in the making of the famous kottayam cheriapally and the kottayam valiyapally.The Venkadathu Family member’s served as personal staff of the king. Later they moved to Thiruvanchoor region of Kottayam district due to slight misunderstanding with the king in the matters of the church.Later on the king recognised his fault and invited them to Kottayam. So a portion of them moved back to Kottayam.</p>
       <p class="style1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present the family’s members lives around Kottayam district of Kerala and other districts of Kerala, various states across India and various others countries of the world with about more than 70 sub-families (considering each married male of the family owning a subfamily).Today the Venkadathu Family members are active members in the various activities of the church and the society as they were in the past. Many of the members of this family hold many prestigious posts in the church as well as the society as well from the past as well as the present with the grace of the almighty God.</p>
